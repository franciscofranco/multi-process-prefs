# Shared Preferences through multi processes

Forked from https://github.com/TreeFrogApps/MultiProcessPreferences for personal use.
Has been modified/enhanced by me to add missing features and fixing a couple issues too.

Probably still needs a few cleanups & code quality improvements which I'll eventually go through as needed.

Kudos to TreeFrogApps for the initial working implementation.
Use this as is, or pull request if you have suggestions for improvements.

This isn't a "library" per-se. I don't provide support of any kind.
